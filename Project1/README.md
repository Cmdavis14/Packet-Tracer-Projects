# Packet Tracer Project: Project #1 Simple Network
## Project Overview
This project involved designing and configuring a network with two subnets using Cisco Packet Tracer. The network was divided into two main subnets: Accounts and Delivery. The goal was to demonstrate basic networking concepts, subnetting, and router configuration.

## Objectives
- Design a network topology with two distinct subnets.
- Configure IP addressing for each subnet.
- Set up routing between the two subnets.
- Ensure proper communication and connectivity between devices in different subnets.

## Network Topology
Subnet 1: Accounts
- IP Range: 192.168.40.0/25
- Devices: PC0, PC1, Printer1

Subnet 2: Delivery
IP Range: 192.168.40.128/25
Devices: PC2, Printer0, PC3

## Key Learnings
- Subnetting: Gained hands-on experience in subnetting and IP address allocation. Learned how to divide a network into multiple subnets and assign appropriate IP addresses to devices.
- Router Configuration: Configured routers to manage traffic between different subnets. Implemented static routing to ensure that devices in one subnet could communicate with devices in the other.
- IP Addressing: Practiced assigning IP addresses to devices within each subnet. Ensured no IP address conflicts and verified connectivity between devices.
- Troubleshooting: Identified and resolved common networking issues. Used commands such as ping, traceroute, and show commands to troubleshoot and verify network connectivity.
- Network Design Principles: Applied fundamental network design principles to create a functional and efficient network. Considered factors such as network performance, scalability, and security.

## Conclusion
This project enhanced my understanding of subnetting, routing, and network configuration. It provided practical experience in setting up and managing a basic network, which is foundational for more advanced networking concepts.

## Future Improvements
- Dynamic Routing: Explore dynamic routing protocols such as OSPF or EIGRP.
- Network Security: Implement security measures such as ACLs (Access Control Lists) and firewall rules.
- Advanced Subnetting: Experiment with more complex subnetting scenarios and larger networks.
