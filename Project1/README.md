Packet Tracer Project: Two-Subnet Network
Project Overview
This project involved designing and configuring a network with two subnets using Cisco Packet Tracer. The network was divided into two main subnets: Accounts and Delivery. The goal was to demonstrate basic networking concepts, subnetting, and router configuration.

Objectives
Design a network topology with two distinct subnets.
Configure IP addressing for each subnet.
Set up routing between the two subnets.
Ensure proper communication and connectivity between devices in different subnets.
Network Topology
Subnet 1: Accounts

IP Range: [Insert IP range]
Devices: [List devices, e.g., PCs, switches, etc.]
Subnet 2: Delivery

IP Range: [Insert IP range]
Devices: [List devices, e.g., PCs, switches, etc.]
Key Learnings
Subnetting: Gained hands-on experience in subnetting and IP address allocation. Learned how to divide a network into multiple subnets and assign appropriate IP addresses to devices.

Router Configuration: Configured routers to manage traffic between different subnets. Implemented static routing to ensure that devices in one subnet could communicate with devices in the other.

Switch Configuration: Configured switches to support the network topology. Set up VLANs if necessary and understood how to manage traffic within a subnet.

IP Addressing: Practiced assigning IP addresses to devices within each subnet. Ensured no IP address conflicts and verified connectivity between devices.

Troubleshooting: Identified and resolved common networking issues. Used commands such as ping, traceroute, and show commands to troubleshoot and verify network connectivity.

Network Design Principles: Applied fundamental network design principles to create a functional and efficient network. Considered factors such as network performance, scalability, and security.

Conclusion
This project enhanced my understanding of subnetting, routing, and network configuration. It provided practical experience in setting up and managing a basic network, which is foundational for more advanced networking concepts.

Future Improvements
Dynamic Routing: Explore dynamic routing protocols such as OSPF or EIGRP.
Network Security: Implement security measures such as ACLs (Access Control Lists) and firewall rules.
Advanced Subnetting: Experiment with more complex subnetting scenarios and larger networks.
